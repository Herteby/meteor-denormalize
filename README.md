# Denormalize

This package helps you denormalize you Mongo collections by providing methods for common denormalizations. For example, you can have the name of an author of a post automatically copied into the post. It updates if the author changed name or is removed. This lets you sort you posts after author name very easily. Simply do `Posts.cacheDoc('author', Authors, ['name'])`.

**NOTE: The package API only works on the server!**

All this is done using the [collection-hooks package](https://github.com/matb33/meteor-collection-hooks). The updates are currently only done on the server using the `after` hooks and `Meteor.defer()` so they don't block further execution. The client will not see the changes to the cached fields until they're pushed from the server.

[Read the API documentation](https://github.com/jeanfredrik/meteor-denormalize/blob/master/api.md)

## *collection*.cacheDoc

Say we have collection called `Posts` and one called `Comments`. One post looks like this:

```javascript
{
	_id: '9f7d606ac1bd7e5167da2fab',
	title: 'My first post',
	content: 'This is my first post'
}
```

And a comment on that post looks like this:

```javascript
{
	_id: 'e4ed559e813dc82d3fc7fd78',
	post_id: '9f7d606ac1bd7e5167da2fab',
	content: 'Great post!'
}
```

Using `Comments.cacheDoc()` we can have the post title appear and stay updated in the related comment:

```javascript
Comments.cacheDoc('post', Posts, ['title']);
```

This will copy the related post from `Posts`, keep only the `title` field and put the copy in the comment under the `_post` field. Now the comment will look like this:

```javascript
{
	_id: 'e4ed559e813dc82d3fc7fd78',
	post_id: '9f7d606ac1bd7e5167da2fab',
	content: 'Great post!',
	_post: {
		title: 'My first post'
	}
}
```

If the title of the post changes the `_post.title` property of the comment changes too, and if the post is removed, so is the `_post` field on the comment.

### Options

In the example, `_post` is the "cache field" and `post_id` is the "reference field". Their names are based on the third argument in the call to `cacheDoc`. If you want to set your own field names you can provide an `options` object:

```javascript
Comments.cacheDoc('post', Posts, ['title'], {
	referenceField: 'postId',
	cacheField: 'cachedPost'
});
```

### Collection helper

If you have the [collection-helpers package](https://github.com/dburles/meteor-collection-helpers/) installed a helper will be created automatically. In the previous example this means that you can call `post()` on a comment to get the related post.

To use another name for the helper, set the `helper` option to a string. If you don't want a helper, set `helper` to `false`:

```javascript
Comments.cacheDoc('post', Posts, ['title'], {
	helper: false //No helper will be created
});
```

## *collection*.cacheCount

Continuing the previous example we can use `Posts.cacheCount()` to store the comment count on each post:

```javascript
Posts.cacheCount('commentsCount', Comments, 'post_id');
```

All posts will now have the `commentsCount` field and the value will update whenever a related comment is inserted/updated/removed. The first argument is the cache field, the second is the target collection and the third is the reference field on the target collection

## *collection*.cacheField

You can use `collection.cacheField` to update a field on a document whenever some other fields on the document changes. Say we want a single field containing both the title and the content so we easily can filter posts based on a text search:

```javascript
Comments.cacheField('_text', ['title', 'content']);
```

The `_text` field is updated when `title` or `content` changes. The result will be:

```javascript
{
	_id: '9f7d606ac1bd7e5167da2fab',
	title: 'My first post',
	content: 'This is my first post',
	_text: 'My first post, This is my first post'
}
```

Now we can run `Posts.find({_text: /first/i})` instead of `Posts.find({$or: [{title: /first/i}, {content: /first/i}]})`.

### The `value` callback

As you can see in the previous example `cacheField` concatenates the watched fields using `', '` as glue. You can change this behavior by providing a callback function that will be used to generate the value. The callback recieves two arguments:

* __doc__ – The document
* __fields__ – An array of the watched fields' names

So if we want `_text` to be lowercase and concatenated with just a space, we would to this instead (using underscore.js):

```javascript
Comments.cacheField('_text', ['title', 'content'], function(doc, fields) {
	return _.map(fields, function(field) {
		return doc[field].toString().toLowerCase();
	}).join(' ');
});
```

Or we could use whatever fields we want, not just the watched ones:

```javascript
Comments.cacheField('_text', ['title', 'content'], function(doc) {
	return doc.title.toLowerCase() + ' ' + doc.content.toLowerCase();
});
```

Note however that the update will only happen when a watched field changes.

## Integration with SimpleSchema/Collection2

If you're using the [collection2 package](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema) and have a schema attached to your collections, Denormalize will bypass validation by default. If you want to validate you must pass `validate: true` as an option.

### Example

Say we have the following schema for our `Posts` collection:

```javascript
new SimpleSchema({
	'title': {
		type: String
	},
	'content': {
		type: String
	}
});
```

And then we run this:

```javascript
Posts.cacheCount('commentsCount', Comments, 'post_id');
```

Collection2 would not allow `commentsCount` to be added to a post since it's not in the schema. Therefore cleaning/validation is bypassed by default. You can prevent this bypass by setting `validate: true`, like this:

```javascript
Posts.cacheCount('commentsCount', Comments, 'post_id', {validate: true});
```

But then you'd also have to add `commentsCount` to the schema:

```javascript
new SimpleSchema({
	'title': {
		type: String
	},
	'content': {
		type: String
	},
	'commentsCount': {
		type: Number
	}
});
```

## Debugging

This packages is quite new and probably has room for improvement. If you experience problems or want to help out you can activate debug messages to see what's going on when the documents are updated. Activate debug messages like this:

```javascript
Denormalize.debug = true;
```
